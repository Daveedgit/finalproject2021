      The environmentally concerned
    </h3>
    <p class="text">
      The sunburst chart illustrates the different choices of clean energy cars that new buyers of Fuel Cell Vehicles opted for in the past. The exploratory visualization investigates whether the income of the household or concern for the environment weighted in strongly towards acquiring a specific vehicle.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      The data to create the chart was transformed from a CSV format to a hierarchical JSON in order to create levels. The innermost ring represents 5 different income groups, separated by their respective tax bracket from 2018. The following ring illustrates the concern for the environment that each household expressed during the survey. And the outer most ring shows the different clean energy vehicles: Battery Electric Vehicles (BVEs), Plug-in Hybrid vehicles (PHEVs), Hybrid Vehicles (HEVs) and Compressed Natural Gas vehicles (CNGs). 
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      It is evident that the choice for clean energy cars is fueled by the concern that each household has for the environment. The HEVs and BEVs were the most purchased, independently of income. It is also necessary to note that the State of California, where the survey took place, subsidizes up to $7000 when acquiring a clean energy vehicle.
